# Course Reflection Blog
When I signed up for this course, I had no idea what to expect. I read the course description and thought it sounded interesting and would help fulfill a requirement. I didn't know what Digital Humanities was or how to define it very well, and after the first day, I was a little overwhelmed. I scrolled through the syllabus, figuring out how to set up my blog, not understanding or knowing the first thing about coding. As the course went on, I started to understand what DH is and enjoyed the projects done in this class. This understanding showed when we were able to rewrite our definition of Digital Humanities at the end of the semester, comparing it to what we had initially put at the start. Although mine didn't change *too* much, I realized that I had a more detailed definition the second time around. This is because of all of the hands-on projects done throughout the semester that allowed me to understand Digital Humanities further.

Blog posts were something that intrigued me when we first learned they'd be assignments. I've always wanted to start a personal blog but had no idea where to start. Being able to create one with assistance felt like an excellent first step. These blog posts were also a great way to get to know my peers. The only one that was solely based on knowing each other was the "About Me" post, but that doesn't mean the rest didn't allow everyone to express themselves. We were able to choose a theme for our blog, apply whatever layout we wanted within our posts, and put pictures of what we found most important. These may be little things, but they all showed aspects of everyone's personality. 

These blog posts also became a great introduction to coding, something we got to see more in-depth through the TEI project. Although GitHub uses markdown coding and TEI uses XML (extensive markup language), being able to have the introduction to a more straightforward type of coding before taking on this project was helpful. The TEI project was something I was nervous about because of what seemed to be complex coding, but I soon realized it was easy to understand. It helped me understand that Digitial Humanities doesn't need to utilize complex programs to create a meaningful impact. Digital editions created from coding allow more accessible texts, and DH projects with these digital editions can help show parts of history. This was something the TEI project helped me learn about digital humanities that I later was able to utilize in my grant project.

The grant project was the one that challenged me the most. It was hard to create a proposal for a project that I had never done or seen, but the layout of this project helped guide me through it. The annotated bibliography was a fantastic start because it allowed my understanding of DH to deepen, creating further knowledge when proposing my project. Finding sources showed me how important research is to DH and allowed me to get a better start on my first draft. Re-reading why these sources were essential to my proposal helped me understand what to put in the grant proposal; it also helped hold me accountable for finishing the project. I think this project was the most difficult but fulfilling of the semester and better prepared me for what projects I might see in my future. 

The last aspect of this class that I thought helped me form my definition of digital humanities was all of the readings and Twitter posts. Twitter was an app I had never used before this class, so using it as a homework assignment allowed me to get comfortable using the app. It also held me accountable for reading our homework assignments since those were mainly what our tweets were about. The readings were repetitive sometimes, but repetition is what helped me learn more. I enjoyed *The Hemmingway App* because it digitally showed a new set of eyes on my blog post. I also thought that *Shitty First Drafts* was helpful going into all of these writing projects because it gave me the confidence not to give up. 

In conclusion, I believe that this class has helped me grow as a writer and researcher while showing me what Digital Humanities is and why it is so important.
