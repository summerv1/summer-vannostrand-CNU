# Course Reflection Blog
When I signed up for this course, I had no idea what to expect. I read the course description and thought it sounded interesting and would help fulfill a requirement. I didn't know what Digital Humanities was or how to define it very well, and after the first day, I was a little overwhelmed. I scrolled through the syllabus, figuring out how to set up my blog, not understanding or knowing the first thing about coding. As the course went on, I started to understand what DH is and enjoyed the projects done in this class. My favorite projects for this class have been our blog posts and the TEI project.

Blog posts were something that intrigued me when we first learned they'd be assignments. I've always wanted to start a personal blog but had no idea where to start. Being able to create one with assistance felt like an excellent first step. These blog posts were also a great way to get to know my peers. The only one that was solely based on knowing each other was the "About Me" post, but that doesn't mean the rest didn't allow everyone to express themselves. We were able to choose a theme for our blog, apply whatever layout we wanted within our posts, and put pictures of what we found most important. These may be little things, but they all showed aspects of everyone's personality.
