# Course Reflection Blog
When I signed up for this course, I had no idea what to expect. I read the course description and thought it sounded interesting and would help fulfill a requirement. I didn't know what Digital Humanities was or how to define it very well, and after the first day, I was a little overwhelmed. I scrolled through the syllabus, figuring out how to set up my blog, not understanding or knowing the first thing about coding. As the course went on, I started to understand what DH is and enjoyed the projects done in this class. My favorite projects for this class have been our blog posts and the TEI project.
