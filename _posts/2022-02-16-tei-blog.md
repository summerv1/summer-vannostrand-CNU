# Oxygen Reflection

## Learning to Code in XML

For this project, I was given a passage from Bram Stoker’s “Dracula’s Guest.” The assignment was to code the text that I was given using **T**ext **E**ncoding **I**nitiative (TEI) in Oxygen. Oxygen is a coding program that uses e**x**tensible **m**arkup **l**anguage, or, XML which is something I am new to. Going into this, I had no clue what I was going to do or what to expect, and now that I’ve done it I’m going to explain my process. 

### Starting with Google Docs

To start the project, I was given a Google Doc where I highlighted and left comments on everything from em-dashes to quotes, these I would need to tag once I got to the actual coding process. This allowed me to feel more comfortable with what I was about to do because I knew where to start. Below, I have placed a screenshot of my Google Doc. I am a very visual learner, so only using the comment option was confusing for me. I instead used different colors with the highlight tool to show myself what would need to be tagged. I marked quotes in red, new paragraphs in blue, em-dashes with green and the new page was purple. This helped me separate what each tag would be and made the process a lot easier for me.
