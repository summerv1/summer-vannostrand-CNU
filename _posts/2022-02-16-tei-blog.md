# Oxygen Reflection

## Learning to Code in XML

For this project, I was given a passage from Bram Stoker’s “Dracula’s Guest.” The assignment was to code the text that I was given using **T**ext **E**ncoding **I**nitiative (TEI) in Oxygen. Oxygen is a coding program that uses e**x**tensible **m**arkup **l**anguage, or, XML which is something I am new to. Going into this was felt like exploring the unknown, but now that I’ve accomplished it I’m going to explain my process. 

### Starting with Google Docs

To start the project, I was given a Google Doc where I highlighted and left comments on everything from em-dashes to quotes. These were things I'd need to tag once I got to the actual coding process. This allowed me to feel more comfortable with what I was about to do because I knew where to start. Below, I have placed a screenshot of my Google Doc. I am a very visual learner, so only using the comment option was confusing for me. I instead used different colors with the highlight tool to show myself what would need to be tagged. I marked quotes in red, new paragraphs in blue, em-dashes with green and the new page was purple. This helped me separate what each tag would be and made the process a lot easier for me.

### Oxygen and XML

The day we started to use Oxygen, I went in unsure of what to expect. After opening the app on the provided laptops, all of my fears felt like they came to life. All of the random codes and words were so new and confusing to me, and even though my professor was talking the class through how to get started I still somehow messed up. As I was copying and pasting the initial codes into the TEI file I had created I noticed a red line underlining most of my code. I was unsure where I went wrong, and was too impatient to ask, so instead I restarted the project with a new file.

The second time around, no more issues arose and I was able to play around with XML tags, as they were something new to me. It was comforting to be able to utilize the class website and find a “cheat sheet” of what each tag meant, as they were something unknown to many of my classmates and myself. As I continued the project I realized how simple the process was once learning the meaning of each tag. The peer review in class helped me further, as Rebecca was able to point out parts where I missed details in my code. I even noticed that I had an em-dash that I had forgotten to tag. Below, I have inserted a picture of my final XML code.

### Final Thoughts
I learned how meticulous coding truly is and that one forgotten detail, no matter how minor it may seem, can mess the whole project up. Being able to learn something new, even through the trial and error I faced in the beginning was something I enjoyed during this project. I really hope to see and use Oxygen again in the future.
