I am a sophomore at [Christopher Newport University,](https://cnu.edu) **double majoring** in English and Communications. I am taking this course to fulfill my English requirements, but I am super excited to learn more about Digital Humanities. I'm not sure what I want to do after graduation, but I know that what I'm passionate about is writing and animals. I want to find a way to combine the two, possibly working in PR at an animal shelter. I feel like with the digital world we live in today learning how to write online is so valuable.
