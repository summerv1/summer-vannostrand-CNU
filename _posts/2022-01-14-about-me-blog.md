I am a sophomore at [Christopher Newport University,](https://cnu.edu) **double majoring** in English and Communications. I am taking this course to fulfill my English requirements, but I am super excited to learn more about Digital Humanities. I'm not sure what I want to do after graduation, but I know that what I'm passionate about is writing and animals. I want to find a way to combine the two, possibly working in PR at an animal shelter. That's why I chose English and Communications, I feel like the two combined will help me with the path I want to go in. Especially because of the digital world we live in today, learning how to write online is so valuable. 
English has _always_ been a love of mine. What started out as reading all the time, turned into wanting to learn how to write like the authors I love so much. Communications was something new that I tried last semester, but was unsure about. My first communications class was Public Speaking, which **terrified** me. Speaking infront of people is not my strong suit. As the class went on, though, I slowly fell in love with it and realized that communications was something I wanted to continue so I added it as a major.
