I am a sophomore at [Christopher Newport University,](https://cnu.edu) **double majoring** in English and Communications. I am taking this course to fulfill my English requirements, but I am super excited to learn more about Digital Humanities. I'm not sure what I want to do after graduation, but I know that what I'm passionate about is writing and animals. I want to find a way to combine the two, possibly working in PR at an animal shelter. That's why I chose English and Communications, I feel like the two combined will help me with the path I want to go in. Especially because of the digital world we live in today, learning how to write online is so valuable. 

English has _always_ been a love of mine. What started out as reading all the time, turned into wanting to learn how to write like the authors I love so much. Communications studies was something new that I tried last semester, but was unsure about. My first communications class was Public Speaking, which **terrified** me. Speaking in front of people is not my strong suit. As the class went on, though, I slowly fell in love with it and realized that communications was something I wanted to continue so I added it as a major. I am beyond excited to see how it helps me grow through the next few years here. 

On campus, I am also involved in the sorority [Delta Gamma](https://deltagamma.org/). This sorority has helped me grow so much in the past year that I have been a member, and I currently have two positions. I am our PR person, which means I organize the tabling for our philanthropy events, I keep in contact with other organizations on campus, and many other things. I really enjoy this so far, because it's nice getting a look at what PR is like, and it's so fun to do with all of my sisters! My second position is a recruitment position, but I wont start that till next semester. Having these positions is something I never imagined myself doing, but I am so glad I put myself out there. I also have and on campus job at the [CNU Office of Advancement](https://giving.cnu.edu/s/1646/bp20/home.aspx?gid=2&pgid=2174) in the call center. Here I call alumni, to keep them involved and up to date with what is happening on campus while also gaining donations for different scholarships. I really enjoy this job because it has definitely **improved** my calling skills.
