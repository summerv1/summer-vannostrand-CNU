### **_Summary_**

_Out of The Desert_ (OOTD) is an in depth study of President Roosevelt’s Executive order 9066. After Pearl Harbor, President Roosevelt signed this executive order that allowed most of the west coast to act under military rule. The order was to create military areas that were allowed to exclude anyone under national defense. Although this wasn’t an outright statement in the order, it allowed for the mass incarceration of Japanese and Japanese Americans as orders were sent out to designate coastal areas of California, Oregon and Washington exclusion areas and internment camps were created. OOTD gives an in depth explanation of why these camps were created and what they did, along with how harmful they truly were.
