### **_Summary_**

_Out of The Desert (OOTD)_ is a study of President Roosevelt’s Executive order 9066 following Pearl Harbor. Orders were sent out to designate coastal areas of California, Oregon and Washington exclusion areas and internment camps were created. The project utilizes an interactive map, photo galleries, and an informational slideshow to show how harmful this order was. 

### **_Design_**

The design uses a standard HTML5 and CSS3, creating cross-browser compatibility. The Out of the Desert project was initially used on a 40-inch touchscreen between January 2015 and February 2016, but for more accessibility they decided to also create the online browser. 

The interactive map in the beginning along with touch screen tours through pictures of old yearbook pages or post cards allow users who aren’t in person to be able to still get the same effects as they would at the in person display. This creates an immersive experience for the viewer without having to leave their home. 

### **_Review_**


As said in my brief summary, _Out of the Desert_  prompts you with an interactive map. The houses placed on the map allow you to learn more about these internment camps and more research on what assembly centers and other information on their location and populations. This part initially confused me because only some houses told me about assembly centers while others told me about _that specific_ center. I soon realized that what I saw depended on the size of the houses. I felt as if putting some type of instruction on that would have helped me not continue to reread the same things about assembly centers. 
#### Here is what the small houses showed.

As I continued to explore _Out of the Desert_ I decided to look at the picture gallery. I thought this part was a huge insight to what these internment camps were and how they affect those forced into internment camps. The gallery showed pictures that people in the camps took to document these moments in their lives. I also was able to read postcards and letters sent from those in the camps, which was very devastating to read at some points. Some of these letters were typed out and others were handwritten which made them difficult to read sometimes. Most of the handwritten ones had a summary of what I was about to read, which I thought was a good addition to the images and OOTD and I felt that all of them should have this description. I noticed that while I was reading the summaries that the website would move me to the image slide - sometimes before I could finish reading. I felt that it might make these postcards an easier read if I was able to go at my own pace, instead of having to continue to go back to the previous slide. Another thing to mention is that there were squares randomly placed next to the summaries. I’m not sure if the squares were used to show where a word moved into the next line before finishing it, or if it was a coding error. Either way, these squares almost made the reading take longer for me. 
#### This is an image of a postcard without a description. As you can see, it's written in cursive making it difficult to read.

#### And this is an example of the descriptions given with other letters. This made what I was about to read clearer. As you can see, there are squares placed that could throw the reader off.

Lastly, I was unable to find the creator of this project. I knew that OOTD was a DH blog created at Yale University, but there were no names for who created it or what their credentials were. I would have liked to know that information because my critiques might’ve been slightly different if it had been a professor in comparison to a student made project. 

In conclusion, I think that it was very well created and the usability wasn’t bad despite some confusion along the way. I think Out of the Desert does a very good job at showing you the causes and effects of internment camps during WWII and just how much they affected their communities. It took a topic I had only learned a little about in high school, and gave me an in depth understanding of how harmful order 9066 truly was.
