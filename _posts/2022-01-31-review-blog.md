### **_Summary_**

_Out of The Desert_ (OOTD) is a study of President Roosevelt’s Executive order 9066 following Pearl Harbor. Orders were sent out to designate coastal areas of California, Oregon and Washington exclusion areas and internment camps were created. OOTD gives an in-depth explanation of why these camps were created and how they consequently led to the mass incarceration of Japanese and Japanese Americans. 

### **_Design_**

The design uses a standard HTML5 and CSS3, creating cross-browser compatibility. The _Out of the Desert_ project was initially used on a 40-inch touchscreen between January 2015 and February 2016, but for more accessibility they decided to also create the online browser. They needed to utilize a software that would work on both which is why they chose the CSS, which allowed the resolutions to look the same on any device. 

The interactive map in the beginning along with touch screen tours through pictures of old yearbook pages or post cards allow users who aren’t in person to be able to still get the same effects as they would at the in person display. This creates an immersive experience for the viewer without having to leave their home. 

### **_Review_**


When the site is first open, there is an image of the map prompting you to click on the screen to learn more. There are two ways you can do this, either exploring the map first or exploring the paragraph at the bottom of the screen. I chose the map first, because it caught my attention more than the paragraph. I clicked on the houses to learn more about the internment camps and that’s where I started to get confused. Some houses only showed me information about what exactly the assembly centers were while others explained more about that specific center. After messing around with the site, I realized that the houses that appeared smaller would show me more information about the assembly centers while the larger ones told you about what was in that specific area. It was an easy thing to figure out, but initially it confused me. Below I have pasted two images that show what I am talking about.

As I continued to explore _Out of the Desert_ I decided to look at the picture gallery. I thought this part was a huge insight to what these internment camps were and how they affect those forced into internment camps. The gallery showed pictures that people in the camps took to document these moments in their lives. I also was able to read postcards and letters sent from those in the camps, which was very devastating to read at some points. Some of these letters were typed out and others were handwritten which made them difficult to read sometimes. Most of the handwritten ones had a summary of what I was about to read, which I thought was a good addition to the images and OOTD and I felt that all of them should have this description. I noticed that while I was reading the summaries that the website would move me to the image slide - sometimes before I could finish reading. I felt that it might make these postcards an easier read if I was able to go at my own pace, instead of having to continue to go back to the previous slide. 
#### This is an image of a postcard without a description. As you can see, it's written in cursive making it difficult to read.

#### And this is an example of the descriptions given with other letters. This made what I was about to read clearer.
